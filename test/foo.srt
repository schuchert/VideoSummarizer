1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,040


2
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,080
What you see on the bottom of the screen

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,840
is the updated version of the heart rate

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:06,560
monitor, or

5
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,840
heart rate variability

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,280
and heart rate,

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,760
and it's got it tuned to be sort of

8
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:13,320
smoother as opposed to

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:14,960
more jittery. It's

10
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,880
just gonna be running throughout.

11
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,800
My heart rate starting, or my heart rate

12
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,080
variability is starting at

13
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,760
51 tonight or something like that.

14
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm not sure what it shows right now, I

15
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,160
can't quite see it, but I'll work on that next,

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,360
and

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,880
we'll see what it does.

18
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,240
Last night,

19
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
my heart rate variability improved a bit.

20
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,800
I don't remember what the numbers were, but

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,480
it

22
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,560
doesn't really matter.

23
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,200
I've got

24
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,160
it logged.

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,320
And again, the whole purpose of this is

26
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,520
I discovered accidentally that the thing

27
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
I'm about to do

28
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,960
seems to be really good.

29
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,440
It sort of seems to give you mental boost,

30
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,640
cardio boost,

31
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,960
helps me with sleep, et cetera.

32
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,240
And it's a very simple activity.

33
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
And let's go ahead and get started. So

34
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,300
